# euptf
This is the code of R package euptf version 1.4 from 22 July 2016

The euptf package provides pedotransfer functions (PTFs) for the prediction of hydraulic properties
in European soils. The PTFs were trained and validated on subsets of the European Hydropedological
Data Inventory (Weynants et al., 2013, EU-HYDI). The methodology and the results are published in the
European Journal of Soil Science (Tóth et al., 2014).
